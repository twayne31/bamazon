**Creating an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL and Node.js that will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.**

The customer will be able to:
  1. Search the department they would like to shop for.
  1. Find the product within the department that they selected.
  1. Buy the product, by entering the amount in which they want.
  1. See the total for the purchase.
